Here are some other tutorials I found which might be useful.

Alternatively, you can use Kubernetes (which is much more expensive). 
Here are some tutorials for that.  

To create kubernetes deployments out of Docker containers  
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/kube-deploy/

To create Docker Swarm deployments out of docker containers  
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/swarm-deploy/

To deploy RShiny on Kubernetes from scratch:
